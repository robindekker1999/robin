            <h2>Incorporating Information Design into real life projects</h2>
            <div>
                <p>During the Information Design minor, we worked on a project for a real client, giving us the opportunity to apply everything we had learned about information design. While the project was initially quite challenging, we tackled it step by step and collaborated effectively as a team to find solutions.</p>
                
                <p>The central question we aimed to address was: <span>What is the best way to present and make the taxonomic and evolutionary findings of the Brassicaceae family accessible to scientists and other audiences?</span>
                </p>

                <p>For this project I worked together with Roosmarijn Hoekstra (design) and Brianne de Deugd (tech). Together with Roosmarijn we laid our focus on incorporating all of the requirements into te design. Those requirements exist of making the tree the focus point, being able to click and zoom, adding filter options and a switch to a world map. The first few weeks we spent our timing researching possibilities and sketching ideas. Some of those topics were about the shape of the Tree of Life, the filter options and the overall look of the UI. </p>

            <h2>Challenges and key decisions for the BrassiToL app</h2>
            <div>
                <p>During the Naturalis project, the team was tasked with designing an interactive phylogenetic tree for the Brassicaceae family. This tree needed to serve two distinct audiences: <span>scientists seeking detailed evolutionary data and students needing simplified, accessible information.</span> Balancing these requirements posed a significant challenge, especially in visualizing complex evolutionary relationships in a way that was both scientifically accurate and easy to understand.</p>
                
                <p>To address this, as a team we <span>explored various visualization formats</span>, including circular and hierarchical tree layouts. After careful consideration and feedback from the client, we decided on a half-circle design. This format offered a clearer view of the data while maximizing screen space and improving readability. Insights from coaching sessions and user feedback highlighted the importance of maintaining both high-level overviews and the ability to see specific details, which shaped the interactive functionality of the tree where the user can zoom in and out.</p>

                <p>A key part of the process involved prioritizing features using the MoSCoW method. This framework helped the team identify must-have elements, such as <span>interactive zoom, filters for taxonomy, and search capabilities</span>, as well as should-have features like <span>geographical overlays and data summaries</span>. This structured approach ensured that the most critical functionalities were delivered on time, while leaving room for potential future enhancements.</p>

                <p>Throughout the project, close collaboration with the client and iterative testing allowed our team to refine our decisions. For example, we incorporated path-highlighting, enabling users to visualize evolutionary connections between species. This feature, particularly valued by scientists, helped make the tree more dynamic and informative.</p>
