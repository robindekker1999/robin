            <h2>Growing as a visual designer by working on real-world projects</h2>
            <div>
                <p>During my internship at bol.com, I focused on growing as a visual designer within the Creative Studio, where I worked on projects such as branding materials, CMS migration, and animating visual elements. Weekly presentations honed my ability to communicate ideas clearly to stakeholders, incorporating feedback effectively. Collaboration across roles and disciplines taught me to integrate feedback and maintain stakeholder communication.</p>
                
                <p>One of my major responsibilities was the migration of the CMS, where I applied bol.com's brand identity to ensure consistency across the new platform. This involved redesigning and updating visuals to ensure they aligned with the platform's layout and functionality. I worked on creating clean, intuitive designs that enhanced usability while preserving bol.com's distinct visual style. This project deepened my understanding of brand consistency and the importance of user-centered design in large-scale digital transformations.</p>

            <h2>Other projects I worked on and refining skills</h2>
            <div>
                <p>During the Intranet project at bol.com, I was responsible for creating the design and visual materials to support the platform's internal launch. This included designing narrowcasting visuals to announce the launch and creating materials that clearly communicated the benefits and functionalities of the new intranet to employees. This project reinforced my skills in balancing branding with infromation structures and enhanced my ability to deliver clear, impactful communication within a corporate setting.</p>

                <p>I worked on the Cadeauwinkel project, a section of bol.com focused on curating gifts for various occasions. My role involved creating visually appealing materials that aligned with the brand's playful and customer-focused identity. I contributed to the design of banners and promotional content, ensuring they were engaging and intuitive for users. This project allowed me to refine my skills in conceptualizing user-friendly designs while maintaining bol.com's unique style.</p>

                <p>A highlight of my internship was learning to animate bol.com's visual style. I started with rough sketches, iteratively refined the designs, and created animations that aligned with the brand's identity.</p>
